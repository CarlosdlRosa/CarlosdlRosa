- 👋 Hi there, my name is Carlos de la Rosa
- A passionate Data Analyst Junior in a constant process of learning.
- 📝 With 2 degrees in Hispanic Philology and Literary Studies, I am currently in a beautiful and thrilling phase of reshaping my professional career, where I feel the excitement of being 'reborn' both professionally and personally.
- 🔭 I am looking for my first job as a Data Analyst to start applying my skills in a business environment and to enhance all the knowledge and technical skills I have acquired over the past few months.
- 👨‍💻 Advanced skills on Excel and PowerPoint. Intermediate knowledge in SQL, Python, R and Tableau.
- 📄 Certificate holder in Google Data Analytics.
- ⚡ I have a broad and varied work experience, from which I will highlight my last two jobs. I worked for almost a year at International SOS (Prague, Czech Republic) as an administrative side by side with a very competent and fully multicultural team. Additionally, I am currently leading a Spanish course for teachers at a Federal Institute in the south of Brazil.
